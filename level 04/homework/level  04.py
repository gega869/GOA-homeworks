#there has the be the symbol "" not the symbol ;;

#2

num2 = ('two")
 #the mistake is that we used '" too. only thng  we should be using is "" for string   

#3

num3 = "three'    
 #looks like for this one we have 2 errors. we have to use "" not "' and we typed num3 = "three" over at the print is Num3 n is a capital letter witch can cause an error.
print(Num3)

num4 = "number4    
 #even if num4 means number4 its not the same in programing. the meaning dosnt matter it has to be the same exact thing num4 has to be num4 not number4

5num = 'five'    #i dont undertsand why 5num is red but we have to use "" symbols not '' i think..
